Our team has prepared for an ICO. However, we are worried that there might a way to exploit the smart contracts in such a way that new investors won't be able to invest anymore. Can you spot the bug and prove us right? 

Each "victim" will have two investors. Your goal is to make impossible for our investor to invest money when "get_flag" is called.
